# dino_scraper
This web app lets users view and leave comments on content pieces. Without writing any articles, I utilize Mongoose and Cheerio to scrape suited content from another site. NPM packages involved include: express, express-handlebars, mongoose, body-parser, cheerio, request. I deploy to Heroku using an mLab provision, which is a remote MongoDB database Heroku natively supports.
